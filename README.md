# Gap Assessment ‚Äì Employee Security Training

This repository contains a simple example of a **Gap Assessment** for an information security control: **Employee Security Training**.

## üìã Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to create a small GRC-related project that can be uploaded to GitHub.  
It shows how to:
- Define a control or requirement.
- Evaluate its current status.
- Identify gaps.
- Suggest improvements.

## üóÇÔ∏è Files
- **employee_security_training.csv**  
  A CSV file that includes the gap assessment for Employee Security Training.

| Control | Question | Score (1-5) | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Employee Security Training | Are employees trained periodically on information security? | 2 | Partial | Logs of training employees show that not all employees took training | Make more training drills for the rest of employees |

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the CSV file using Excel or Google Sheets to view it as a table.
3. Modify or add new assessments to practice.

## üéØ Learning Outcome
This mini-project helps you build your portfolio by showing:
- Understanding of basic security controls.
- Ability to identify gaps and recommend improvements.
- Use of standard formats (CSV + Markdown).

‚≠ê **Next Step**:  
Add more controls (e.g., Access Management, Incident Response) to the same CSV or create new CSV files for each control.
